## Dungeon Creepy Crawlers
Github link: https://github.com/josharaedwards/ICS167_DungeonBugs <br/><br/>
I worked with 2 other teammates to design and develop a 2D Grid-based Turn-based game that is inspired by the Fire Emblem series. <br/>
In this project, I was the lead game engineer, built entirely from scratch an interactable grid system that would contain all of the objects of a level and the basis of the game UI. I utilized mainly the observer and delegate design patterns to build this system. I was also the lead game designer for the project. <br/><br/>

## Extractive Text Summarization
Github link: https://github.com/tuantruong5770/text-summarization <br/><br/>
I worked with 2 other teammates to build and design a hierarchical neural network for extractive text summarization based on this paper: [Fast Abstractive Summarization with Reinforce-Selected Sentence Rewriting by Chen et.al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11080.pdf) <br/>
I was mainly responsible for researching and designing the model. Our detailed report of the project can be found ![here](https://github.com/dienn1/UCSC-Portfolio/blob/41dea3bd17f43696f5b7999661f4b1deb04eaa15/Extractive%20Summarization/TEAMNAME_final_report_2022.pdf) <br/>

## Terrain Generation
Github link: https://github.com/dienn1/UCSC-Portfolio/tree/main/Terrain%20Generation <br/>
The Demo is in the Build folder. A new terrain is generated every time the build is run. <br/>
Everything is made by myself except for the smoke texture.
