## Dungeon Creepy Crawlers
Github link: https://github.com/josharaedwards/ICS167_DungeonBugs <br/><br/>
I worked with 2 other teammates to design and develop a 2D Grid-based Turn-based game that is inspired by the Fire Emblem series. <br/>
In this project, I was the lead game engineer, built entirely from scratch an interactable grid system that would contain all of the objects of a level and the basis of the game UI. I utilized mainly the observer and delegate design patterns to build this system. I was also the lead game designer for the project. <br/><br/>
